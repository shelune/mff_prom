We are happy to announce that the 3rd annual October #Beatz Music Show is about to get underway.

	* Last year blast
	We were happy to receive such great support from you guys in 2014 and 2015 October Beatz. With that in mind, we can't help but get eager to prepare for this year October Beatz. This is gonna be awesome!!!

	* New preparation plan
	It has been 2 years with joy and struggle alike. In 2016, we brought in a new framework to plan our show so everything will be going smoothly. Of course it is behind the scene so all you need to do is sit back and enjoy the show later on.

- Section 2
	* Remember this guy?
	He was rocking the show for the last 5 consecutive songs in 2015. This year he's gonna take a step back and take different position so newcomers can join the fun too. Also this girl if you miss her, but she will also stand in the audience along with you guys.

	* The new faces
	They may be new or they may be not, but here in October #Beatz, they are just about to get their first step onto the stage!
